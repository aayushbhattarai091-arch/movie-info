		<p>Hello, I am Aayush Bhattarai, and this website is a personal collection of my favorite movies that I’d love to share and recommend to everyone who enjoys cinema. Here, you will find films from almost every genre — from thrilling action to thought-provoking dramas — except romance and horror, which I personally don’t prefer 😆. Each movie page contains key details such as the plot, cast, and release year, along with my honest opinions and reviews based on my own viewing experience. My goal is to help visitors discover great films and understand what makes them special. Whether you are a casual viewer or a true movie enthusiast, I hope this site helps you find your next favorite film. If you have any suggestions, recommendations, or want to share your thoughts, feel free to contact me through the links below.:</p>
